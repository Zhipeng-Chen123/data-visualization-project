# data-visualization-project on climate changes by R
The graph want to make data visualization are  just from https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/eu-power-sector-2020/
I use the data from the website to make my graph similar to the graph in the website as much as possible.
I attached my target graph snapshot from the website and also my R code in Rmarkdown document to illustrate my data visualization process
